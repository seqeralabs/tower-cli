# Nextflow Tower CLI

`tw` is [Tower](https://tower.nf/) on the command line. It brings Tower concepts including Pipelines, Actions and Compute Environments to the terminal.

Tower is a full-stack application for the management of data pipelines and compute resources. It enables collaborative data analysis at scale, on-premises or in any cloud.

The Tower CLI interacts with Tower, providing an interface to launch pipelines, manage cloud resources and administer your analysis.

The key features are:

- **A Nextflow-like experience**: Tower CLI provides a developer friendly environment. Pipelines can be launched with the CLI similar to Nextflow but with the benefits of Tower such as monitoring, logging, resource provisioning, dataset management and collaborative sharing.

- **Infrastructure as Code**: All Tower resources including Pipelines and Compute Environments can be described in a declarative manner. This allows a complete definition of an analysis environment that can be versioned and treated as code. It greatly simplifies sharing and re-use of configuration as well as routine administration.

- **Built on OpenAPI**: Tower CLI interacts with Tower via the [Tower API](https://tower.nf/openapi/index.html) which is created using the latest OpenAPI 3.0 specification. Tower CLI provides full control of the Tower application allowing users to get maximum insights into their pipeline submissions and execution environments.

For more information on Tower, see the [user documentation](https://help.tower.nf) on the Tower Cloud website.

## Availability

Tower CLI can be installed on macOS, Windows, and Linux.

It is compatible with [Tower Cloud](https://tower.nf/) and Tower Enterprise versions 21.08 and later.

## Getting Started

This guide covers the installation and configuration of the CLI, cloud infrastructure provisioning and launching pipelines into an AWS Batch compute environment.

### 1. Installation

1. Download the latest version for your OS from the assets in the [releases](https://github.com/seqeralabs/tower-cli/releases) page.

2. Rename and make the file executable:

    ```bash
    mv tw-* tw
    chmod +x ./tw
    ```

3. Move the file to a directory accessible by your `$PATH` variable:

    ```bash
    sudo mv tw /usr/local/bin/
    ```

### 2. Configuration

Create a Tower access token using the [Tower](https://tower.nf/) web interface via the **Your Tokens** page in your profile.

Providing `tw` access to Tower with your access token can be achieved in several ways:

1. Export it directly into your terminal:

    ```bash
    export TOWER_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your access token>
    ```

2. Add the above `export` command to a file such as `.bashrc` to be automatically added into your environment.

3. Specify your token as a parameter when running `tw`:

    ```bash
    tw --access-token=<your access token> <other options>
    ```

If required, you can configure the following non-mandatory environment variables using the same methods above:

- `TOWER_WORKSPACE_ID`: Workspace id. Default: The user workspace.
- `TOWER_API_ENDPOINT`: Tower API URL. Default: `api.tower.nf`.

> You can find the `TOWER_WORKSPACE_ID` for a given organisation in its **Workspaces** page as shown in [this image](assets/img/workspace_id.png).

### 3. Health check

Confirm the installation, configuration and connection is working as expected:

```console
$ tw info

    System health status
    ---------------------------------------+------------------
     Remote API server connection check    | OK
     Tower API version check               | OK
     Authentication API credential's token | OK
```

### 4. View available commands

Use the `-h` or `--help` parameter to list the available commands and their associated options.

```bash
tw --help
```

### 5. Add credentials

To launch pipelines on AWS Batch, you will need to add credentials to the appropriate Tower Workspace.

```bash
tw credentials add aws --name=my_aws_creds --access-key=<aws access key> --secret-key=<aws secret key>
```

> See the [IAM policy](https://github.com/seqeralabs/nf-tower-aws/tree/master/forge) for Tower Forge for recommendations on AWS Batch permissions.

### 6. List credentials

List the credentials available in the workspace.

```bash
tw credentials list
```

### 7. Provision a Compute Environment

Create a Compute Environment for AWS Batch with automatic provisioning of cloud computing resources:

```bash
tw compute-envs add aws-batch forge --name=my_aws_ce --region=eu-west-1 --max-cpus=256 --work-dir=s3://<bucket name> --wait=AVAILABLE
```

The above command will create all of the required AWS Batch resources in the AWS Ireland (`eu-west-1`) region with a total of 256 CPUs provisioned in the compute environment. An existing S3 bucket will be used as the work directory when running Nextflow. Also, it will wait until all the resources are AVAILABLE and ready to use.

Comprehensive details about Tower Forge are available in the [user documentation](https://help.tower.nf/compute-envs/aws-batch/#forge).

> If you have multiple credentials matching the same compute environment, you will need to provide the `--credentials-id` obtained by running `tw credentials list`.

### 8. Add a pipeline

Add a pre-configured pipeline that can be re-used later:

```bash
tw pipelines add --name=my_sleepy_pipeline --params-file=<(echo 'timeout: 60') https://github.com/pditommaso/nf-sleep
```

Pipelines consist of a pipeline repository, launch parameters, and a Compute Environment. When a Compute Environment is not specified the primary one is used.

> The `params-file` option should be a YAML or JSON file. Here we use a Bash pipe to convert a command into a YAML file automatically.

### 9. Launch it!

```bash
tw launch my_sleepy_pipeline
```

Add a `--wait=SUCCEEDED` if you want the command to wait until the pipeline execution is complete.

When using `--wait`, `tw` can exit with one of two exit codes:

- `0`: When the run reaches the desired state.
- `1`: When the run reaches a state that makes it impossible to reach the desired state.

### 10. Change launch parameters

Launch the pipeline with different parameters:

```bash
tw launch my_sleepy_pipeline --params-file=<(echo 'timeout: 30')
```

### 11. Update a pipeline

The default launch parameters can be changed using the `update` command:

```bash
tw pipelines update --name=my_sleepy_pipeline --params-file=<(echo 'timeout: 30')
```

### 12. Launch a pipeline directly

It is also possible to directly launch pipelines that have not been explicitly added to a Tower Workspace by using the pipeline repository URL:

```bash
tw launch https://github.com/nextflow-io/hello
```

## Launch Examples

The `tw launch` command provides a similar user experience to `nextflow run` with the benefits of using Tower.

1. Run a Pipeline pre-defined in a Tower Workspace with a custom parameters file:

    ```bash
    tw launch my_sleepy_pipeline --params-file=./my_params.yaml
    ```

2. Run any Nextflow pipeline using the primary Compute Environment:

    ```bash
    tw launch nf-core/rnaseq
    ```

3. Run any Nextflow pipeline on a specific Compute Environment:

    ```bash
    tw launch nf-core/rnaseq --compute-env=my_aws_ce
    ```

4. Run any Nextflow pipeline and adjust the default profile and parameters:

    ```bash
    tw launch nf-core/rnaseq --profile=test,docker --params-file=./my_params.yaml --compute-env=my_aws_ce
    ```

## Activate autocompletion

You can activate option autocompletion in your current session with the command below:

```bash
source <(tw generate-completion)
```

## Custom SSL certificate authority store

If you are using an SSL certificate that it is not accepted by the default Java certificate authorities you
can [customize](https://www.baeldung.com/jvm-certificate-store-errors) a `cacerts` store and use it like:

```bash
tw -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/absolute/path/to/cacerts info
```

To avoid typing it everytime we recommend to rename the binary to `tw-binary` and create a `tw` script similar
to this:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
tw-binary -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=/absolute/path/to/cacerts $@
```

## Build binary development versions

The Tower CLI is a platform binary executable created by a native compilation from Java GraalVM.

1. Install [SDKMan!](https://sdkman.io/)

2. Install required GraalVM:

    ```bash
    sdk env install
    ```

3. Install `native-image`:

    ```bash
    gu install native-image
    ```

4. Create the native client:

    ```bash
    ./gradlew nativeCompile
    ```

5. Run `tw`:

    ```bash
    ./build/graal/tw
    ```

## Using non-binary development versions

You can run a non-binary development version by executing the [`./tw`](tw) script in the root of this repository.
